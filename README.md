# Description

Homerush is an educational puzzle game where you and a large crew of humans travel the cosmos in search of a suitable planet for the human race after unchecked human development caused the near-complete dehydration of Earth. 
Your job is to aim your spaceship at the right angle and launch at the right speed in order to avoid static and moving planets, stars, asteroid, and other space entities, taking into account the affects of their gravity on your travel.


#Learning Goal

The learning goal of our game is to teach players of our game about physics and space travel.
Space travel is becoming more advanced as time goes on. With the likely chance that space
travel will become a prevalent topic within society in the near and late future, we believe that
teaching the fundamentals on space travel will let people know about some of the basic
concepts of how space travel works. Also, we hope that teaching about space travel will inspire
people to become excited about the prospects of exploring the stars and the universe. Also,
since space travel relies on numerous physics concepts, we will be be teaching fundamentals
about physics that will not only help people understand the world better but also teach them
concepts that they might need to apply in real life, such as understanding how gravity works.

#Technologies used 

Homerush is built using a Java Game engine manually implemented in over the course of  CMSC 209. This provides the basic game loop,
sprite and animated sprite handiling, audio handling, game drawing, and user input. Gravity effects are manually implemented as well.

#MVP Specs

In the MVP branch of this repository you will find our game featuring the following: 

A player controlled spaceship
Stars, planets and asteroids with different gravities because they have different masses.

3 universes/levels - one introductory level and two intermediate levels:
      Level 1: 1 star and 1 planet so the players to show that objects can have different gravities
      Level 2: 2 planets of different sizes and 1 moving asteroid so players learn that even moving objects have gavity
      Level 3: 1 star, 2 planet, 1 moon in such an arrangment that players need to use a nonobvious trajectory in order to utilize the gravity of certain objects to get to the target
